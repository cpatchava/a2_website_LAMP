            <p><strong>Step 1: Assessment</strong> </p>
            <p>As with any learning environment, the teachers at Algebra Square will first ask each student to take a test to assess the strengths of weaknesses of each student in various subject areas. The test will allow the tutors to get an idea of whether the student even requires tutoring and if so, which tutoring path should be followed. </p>
            <p><strong>Step 2:Placement</strong></p>
						<p>Once the student is placed in a class most appropriate to their level, they will receive help on homework assignments and will also be tested on material they learn in class. In most cases, we will ensure that students are at least a few lessons of the curriculum of their schoolmates. This will allow the student to apply the concepts he/she learned during tutoring expertly in school.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3:Success</strong></p>
						<p>The final step is watching your student get better grades and gain confidence in themselves and the subject they are being tutored in. We believe that if the student is willing to learn, then, with the right guidance, their determination will ultimately lead to success.</p>
